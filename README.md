# GPIO-led-website-control

This is a website that basically has a dropdown in which you have a red, green, and blue status. You can control the status of these LEDs(on or off), and click on the submit button. This is a simple application to control LEDs using flask. There will be future improvements on making the website more "interactive" by having images, and you can control those images.
